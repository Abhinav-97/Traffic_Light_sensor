# Traffic_Light_sensor
The project is a Traffic light system which analyses the amount of the traffic in the two roads and allows the cars to pass of the road which has more traffic.

Data set consists of randomly generated set denoting cars along the road

The programs computes the distance of all the cars in the 2 roads from the traffic light. The program then applies k-nearest neighbors to determine which cars are closest to the signal .The road which consists of maximum number of such cars  obviously has the higher traffic density and  is
Allowed the access.
